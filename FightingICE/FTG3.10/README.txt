After placing the jar file of each of the AIs you want to run in the data/ai/ directory 
(some AIs may require another folder under data/aiData/; 
for this please see the description of Switch sample AI below.), 
you can boot the game by clicking Run.

After booting, you can move the arrow cursor by pressing arrow keys.
When you press Z while the arrow cursor is at FIGHT, the game enters the 
fight-preparation screen.
